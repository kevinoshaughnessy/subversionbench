Re-running the awareness grader over episodes already collected.

Scoring a past batch with a different grader otherwise means re-running the whole
eval: paying for the agent rollouts again and, because the scenario and the model
are both stochastic, getting different transcripts that cannot be compared with the
originals. Here the transcripts are fixed, so a difference in the numbers is
attributable to the grader.

Its write-back policy is its own: per episode, and skipping any episode whose every
rubric question failed rather than overwriting a real verdict with a failed call.
